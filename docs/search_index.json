"],["intro-to-spatial-data.html", "Intro to Spatial Data", " Intro to Spatial Data This workshop borrows largely from Noli Brazil’s class CRD 230: Spatial Methods in Community Research This workshop will cover some useful packages to wrangle and visualize spatial data. Specifically, we will learn how to pull in data from a few different sources, set a Coordinate Reference System, and create a map. The example here mostly works with vector data, which is characterized by real world objects like a tree, building, forest, etc. The two main packages that deal with vector data in R: sp: the original spatial package in R (first released in 2005) that has a complex data structure sf: much newer, so not as well established as sp, but it is easier to use than sp and is tidy friendly SF stands for “simple feature”. It sees any real-word object (or vector) as a feature and a feature can have both a geometry of where the feature is located and attributes associated with it. For example, a county is a feature with a polygon shape and can have attributes like population, number of hospitals, etc. associated with it. Another example could be a UC Davis, which would have a point geometry. Although, this workshop mostly covers vector data, it will also touch on another type of spatial data called raster data. Raster data is made up of pixels/cells that form a grid filled with information, that is typically continuous in nature (e.g., elevation temperature, land use).

In order to examine this, we will need to bring in US Census data for the City of Davis, as well as point data from fallingfruit.org 0.1 Bring in data Bring in all datasets of interest. In our case, we are going to use three sources of data: 1) City of Davis boundary, 2) census tract data for population and median housing value, and 3) fallenfruit.org fruit tree locations. # You will need to sign up for a Census API Key if you are interested in pulling in US Census data ## Request an API key here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html #census_api_key(&quot;3f1a61d7b9d2f870de53940d461dda896938261b&quot;, install = TRUE) #now stored in my R environment # The tigris packages provides a way to directly download incorporated city footprints ## Pull in in places data for California pl &lt;- places(state = &quot;CA&quot;, year = 2020, cb = FALSE) ## Now let&#39;s just isolate the boundary for the City of Davis davis &lt;- pl %&gt;% filter(NAME == &quot;Davis&quot;) ## Take a look at the dataframe glimpse(davis) # Let&#39;s also pull in some census tract data from the City of Davis ## First, let&#39;s look at what variables are available v20 &lt;- load_variables(2020, &quot;acs5&quot;, cache=TRUE) # load variable options ## Now that we have chosen our variables of interest, let&#39;s pull in that data ca.tracts &lt;- get_acs( geography = &quot;tract&quot;, year = 2020, # final year variables = c(totp = &quot;B01003_001&quot;, #median income medhouse = &quot;B25077_001&quot;), #Median housing value for owner-occupied housing units state = &quot;CA&quot;, output= &quot;wide&quot;, survey = &quot;acs5&quot;, #this loads the data from the last 5 years of acs records geometry = TRUE, cb = FALSE ) # Now bring in fallingfruit.org ## I went onto the website and directly downloaded the csv file fruit &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/data.csv&quot;) 0.2 Data wrangling Oftentimes, you may want to subset spatial data relative to other spatial data. Some common spatial data wrangling tasks: Intersect: keeps all polygons that intersect with the specified spatial boundary Within: keeps all polygons that are wholy within the specified spatial boundary Clipping: clips polygons based on specific spatial extents Areal interpolation: “allocation of data from one set of zones to a second overlapping set of zones that may or may not perfectly align spatially” For this example, I am only interested in the distribuition of fruit trees within Davis. The ms_clip function from rmapshaper is useful for clipping data to the spatial extents of Davis. ## Now I am only interested in Davis census tracts, so I will use the city of davis boundary to clip the tracts ## This function comes from the rmapshaper package davis.tracts &lt;- ms_clip(target = ca.tracts, clip = davis, remove_slivers = TRUE) str(davis.tracts) 0.3 Coordinate Reference System Now that we have all of our data, we need to make sure that each dataset has the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The CRS has two parts: Geographic Coordinate System (GCS): three dimensional spherical surface. The GCS is made up of the ellipse (how the earth’s roundness is calculated) and the datum (coordinate system). Projected Coordinate System (PCS), or “projection”: Flattens the GCS into a two-dimensional Both GCS and PCS need to be specified when working with spatial data! In order to do this, you will first need to find out what CRS your spatial dataset was created in initially. # Check CRS dataframes you want to overlay st_crs(davis.tracts) #NAD 83 st_crs(davis.tracts)$proj4string #&quot;+proj=longlat +datum=NAD83 +no_defs&quot; st_crs(davis.tracts)$units #NULL st_crs(fruit) #NA st_crs(fruit)$proj4string #NA # So let&#39;s reproject the fruit and davis.tracts into the same projection # Reprojection ## First, establish the CRS for the fruit dataset based on how it was created intially ## Since fruit is point data, the projected coordinate system is already set because latitude and longitude are the X-Y coordinates but we need to tell R this fruit.sf &lt;- fruit %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(&quot;lng&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;), crs = &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84&quot;) st_crs(fruit.sf)# +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 ## Now let&#39;s reproject so it is on the same coordinate system as the other dataframes ### By transform to proj = utm, now the CRS can handle distance measures ### UTM: Universal Transverse Mercator works in meters fruit.utm &lt;- fruit.sf %&gt;% st_transform(crs = &quot;+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83 +ellps=GRS80&quot;) ## Reproject davis.tracts to also be in UTM davis.tracts.utm &lt;- davis.tracts %&gt;% st_transform(crs = &quot;+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83 +ellps=GRS80&quot;) # Great, nows lets check to see if all dataframes are on the same CRS st_crs(fruit.utm) == st_crs(davis.tracts.utm) #TRUE 0.4 Mapping the data Finally, we are at the point where we can map the data! Let’s first see what mapping it with tmap looks like. # Map the point data over the census tract data ## tmap tm_shape(davis.tracts.utm) + tm_polygons(col = &quot;medhouseE&quot;, style = &quot;quantile&quot;, palette = &quot;Blues&quot;, title = &quot;Median Housing Value ($)&quot;) + tm_shape(fruit.utm) + tm_dots(col = &quot;green&quot;) + #tm_text(&quot;types&quot;) + tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 1, 2), text.size = 1, position = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) + tm_compass(type = &quot;4star&quot;, position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) + tm_layout(main.title = &quot;Fruit Trees in Davis&quot;, main.title.size = 1.25, main.title.position=&quot;center&quot;, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = &quot;right&quot;, frame = FALSE) Now let’s try mapping with leaflet. ## need to reproject davis.tracts data to be +proj=longlat davis.tracts.sf &lt;- davis.tracts %&gt;% st_transform(crs = &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84&quot;) leaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% addMarkers(data = fruit.sf, popup = ~as.character(types), label = ~as.character(types)) %&gt;% addPolygons(data = davis.tracts.sf, color = ~colorQuantile(&quot;Blues&quot;, totpE, n = 5)(totpE), weight = 1, smoothFactor = 0.5, opacity = 1.0, fillOpacity = 0.5, highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = &quot;white&quot;, weight = 2, bringToFront = TRUE)) 0.5 Fruit Tree Richness What if we wanted to know which areas in Davis have many different species of fruit trees in one place? This is the kind of question that is easier to answer using raster type data. We want to ask, per unit area, how many different types of trees are there. This is easy to represent on a grid.

Verde Arregoitia Grid &lt;- davis %&gt;% #take our davis outline and draw a rectangle around it st_make_grid(n = 25) %&gt;% # let each side of the rectangle have 25 cells st_cast(&quot;MULTIPOLYGON&quot;) %&gt;% #make the grid st_sf() %&gt;% mutate(cellid = row_number()) fruit.types &lt;- fruit.utm %&gt;% group_by(types) %&gt;% # Here group fruit.utm by tree type, note that group by preserves the geometry, turning point classes into multi-point summarise() Grid &lt;- Grid %&gt;% #make sure our grid is matching the CRS of our other layers st_as_sf(coords = c(&quot;lng&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;), crs = &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84&quot;) %&gt;% st_transform(crs = &quot;+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83 +ellps=GRS80&quot;) richness_grid &lt;- Grid %&gt;% st_join(fruit.types) %&gt;% #join the fruit.types layer to the grid mutate(overlap = ifelse(!is.na(types), 1, 0)) %&gt;% #if type is not NA write 1 group_by(cellid) %&gt;% #group by the cell ID&#39;s of the grid summarize(num_types = sum(overlap)) #sum the number of types for each grid cell ggplot(davis.tracts.utm) + #can plot these using GG plot if we are not worried about north arrow or scale bar (prob can do in tmaps but I don&#39;t know that package) geom_sf(aes(fill = medhouseE)) + #lets add our housing values layer scale_fill_viridis_c() + ggnewscale::new_scale_fill() + geom_sf(data = richness_grid, aes(fill = num_types), color = NA) + #add our grid scale_fill_viridis_c(alpha = 1, option = &quot;B&quot;, na.value = &quot;#00000000&quot;, limits = c(1,7), name = &quot;Num tree types per cell&quot;) #I used the limits and na.value fields to make cells where there are no trees clear, so that we can see the background map.
